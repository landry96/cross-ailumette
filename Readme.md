üê® Story
= Prelude

Aillumette is a game based on matches.

    There are a number of match lines.
    The players take turns.
    Each player can take one or more matches on the same line.
    The player who loses is the one who takes the last match.

= Sample

    With node.js

= How

The goal of the project is to make a program that we can play against.

    The basic version must generate a tray of 4 lines of matches
    The output of your program (including error messages) must correspond to examples established above and be written to standard output.
    After the last message (which indicates the winner), there is only one return to the line
    In case of wrong entry to indicate the number of matches to be removed, it is necessary re-display Line: and it's up to the player to re-enter the line on which he wants to play.

üêù Cross

Now that your project, work well, you must add a gui option ; The project must be launch like this:

> node ailumette --gui

Then, an app using Electron JS must be open.
Tips 1

Electron allow you to create real computer app using Javascript. You don't know yet the way it works but you will with thi exercise ;)
Tips 2

The ui libraryis free: React.js, Vue.js or anything else
Tips 3

Try to share a lot of commons code between the cli version (terminal) and the gui
ü¶Ñ Bonus

I know you love that, well you can in bulk:

    Change the number of lines.
    Have the choice between several difficulty levels.
